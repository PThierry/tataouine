# this is the script for setting user environment in order to set the various
# tools paths and names
# this script is separated from the Kconfig content in order to allow the user
# to specify its own paths and name without having them overloaded when using
# defconfig files.
# This file is keeped in git, as it contains all the explanation for all
# requested variables. As the user is intented to update this very variables with
# this own values, this script is sourcing the local file named 'setenv.local.sh'
# in the same way as OpenBSD configuration scripts.
# This permit the user to write a setenv.local.conf file with its own variables
# set, with a fallback to the following variables if not needed.
# The setenv.local.sh file is not requested if the following variables are
# correctly set for the local user's configuration.

# 1) The Ada runtime installation path. This path is the parent directory of
# the gnat cross-toolchain. It should contains directories such as arm-eabi/
# (for the target runtime), /bin (for the host tools), and so on.
# Setting this directory *does not* means that you can avoid adding the bin/ subdir
# of the Ada toolchain to you PATH. This is a required action.

export ADA_RUNTIME="/opt/adacore-arm-eabi"

# 3) This is the path (including the name) of the st-flash tool. This tool
# is used to flash STM32 boards. Setting this path is not required as you
# can flash the target with another tool (gdb+openocd, telnet+openocd, and so
# on).

export ST_FLASH="/usr/local/bin/st-flash"

# 4) This is the path (including the name) of the st-util tool. This tool
# is used to interact with the STM32 boards. Setting this path is not required
# as this is only a helper tool and is not required to build and flash the
# target. Although, it can be helpfull to get back some information about your
# board as it is used by the tataouine 'burn' helper target which compile the
# firmware and flash the device.

export ST_UTIL="/usr/local/bin/st-flash"

# 5) The classical "CROSS_COMPILE" variable, specifying the cross-toolchain prefix.
# This variable is used only for the C compiler (not for Ada which is using its
# own in its gpr files). Depending on your C cross-compiler installation, this
# prefix may varies.
# WARNING: if you use the Ada toochain, please be sure to use the Ada toolchain C compiler
# to avoid unexpected link and run problems due to incompatible compilers versions.
# The AdaCore Ada toolchain is using the arm-eabi- prefix for its toolchain

export CROSS_COMPILE="arm-eabi-"

# 6) By default, the SDK is using GCC for cross-compiling. It is possible to
# use LLVM to get a better static analysis through clang and build-check.
# Although, *this requires clang 7 and higher*. By now, LLVM support is
# *EXPERIMENTAL* and is not yet fully integrated.
# Using LLVM still requires GNU LD greater than 2.30 (which is typically not
# the case if you use the Ada Cross-toolchain integrated CC compiler suite).
# set this variable to 'y' if you which to use LLVM/Clang instead of gcc

export USE_LLVM=n

# 7) Specify clang path, if you clang installation is not standard (multiple
# versions, etc.).
#
export CLANG_PATH="/usr/bin/clang"

# All the above variables are "standard values". Now you can override any of
# them by rewriting 'export VARNAME="content" on your own setenv.local.sh file
# if needed to overload any of the above. For that, just create the setenv.local.sh
# file in this same directory and update the variables you need.

# overriding the above variable with the user configuration, if the file exists.
if test -f setenv.local.sh; then
  source setenv.local.sh
